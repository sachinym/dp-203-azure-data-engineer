# Getting started with Azure Databricks Analytics & Engineering Scenarios

### Overall Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to use Delta Lake within Azure Databricks to implement a lakehouse architecture. Delta Lake combines the scalability of a data lake with the reliability and performance of a data warehouse, enabling efficient batch and streaming data processing. Through a series of tasks, you will provision an Azure Databricks workspace, create a Spark cluster for distributed data processing, and explore Delta Lake functionality using notebooks. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how Delta Lake helps manage structured and unstructured data, supporting analytics and machine learning workflows in Azure Databricks.

## Objective

Learn how to set up an Azure Databricks workspace, create and configure a Spark cluster, analyze data using Spark in notebooks, and exploring Delta Lake functionality to manage and query data efficiently, laying the foundation for a modern data lakehouse solution.

- **Provision an Azure Databricks workspace:** Set up an Azure Databricks workspace using a script to manage clusters, data, and resources in Azure. 

- **Create a cluster:** Create a single-node Spark cluster within the Azure Databricks workspace to process data.

- **Explore data lake using a notebook:** Use a prebuilt notebook to interact with Delta Lake, exploring its functionalities for managing and querying data.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- **Fundamentals of Databricks and Apache Spark:** Awareness of how Databricks works and a basic understanding of Spark concepts like clusters, data processing, and notebooks.

- **General Data Science and Visualization Concepts:** Knowledge of visualizing data using charts and graphs.

- **Understanding of Cloud Shell:** Experience with using Azure Cloud Shell for running scripts and managing Azure resources.

## Architecture

The architecture involves using **Azure Databricks** platform, which integrates Apache Spark for distributed data processing. It begins with provisioning an Azure Databricks workspace within the Azure ecosystem, ensuring seamless integration with other Azure services. The core processing environment is a **Spark cluster**, consisting of a driver node for coordination and worker nodes for executing distributed computations. This cluster is tailored to specific configurations, such as runtime versions and compute resources, to optimize performance. **Notebooks** serve as the interactive interface for executing code, visualizing data, and documenting the workflow. Together, these components enable scalable, efficient, and collaborative data engineering and analysis tasks within the Azure cloud environment.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Azure Databricks Workspace**: This is the central hub for managing and organizing resources, clusters, and notebooks. It integrates Apache Spark with Azure, enabling seamless data processing, collaborative development, and interactive analysis.

- **Apache Spark Cluster**: A key component in Databricks, it enables distributed data processing by using multiple nodes (or a single node in this lab). The cluster performs computations in parallel, speeding up data analysis tasks and handling large datasets efficiently.

- **Databricks Notebooks**: These provide an interactive interface for writing and executing Spark code in languages like Python and SQL. Notebooks combine documentation, data analysis, and visualization into a single environment for efficient exploration and insight generation.
